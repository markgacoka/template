# Fullstack Next.js Template with tRPC, Prisma, and NextAuth

## Overview
This template provides a robust foundation for building fullstack applications using Next.js in conjunction with tRPC for type-safe APIs, Prisma for database ORM, and NextAuth.js for authentication. It’s designed to accelerate development by providing a pre-configured environment with a clean, scalable architecture.

## Technologies
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and building static websites.
- **tRPC**: Type-safe APIs with automatic type inference between the client and server.
- **Prisma**: Database ORM for type-safe database queries.
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication for Next.js applications with built-in support for multiple providers.
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking for JavaScript.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Features
- **Type-Safe Endpoints**: Use tRPC to define and consume APIs with complete type safety.
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with credential provider for custom authentication logic.
- **CRUD Operations**: Example CRUD implementation using Prisma.
- **Client-Side & Server-Side Rendering**: Fully compatible with both CSR and SSR.
- **Utility-First Styling**: Integrated TailwindCSS for rapid UI development.

## Installation
### Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:markgacoka/template.git
cd template
```

### Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Set up the environment variables:
- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Add your environment variables (refer to .env.example).

### Run Prisma migrations and generate Prisma client:
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

### Running the Project
Development:
```
npm run dev
```
- Runs the app in development mode with hot-reloading at http://localhost:3000.

Production:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
- Builds the app for production and serves it.

## Considerations
- **Security**: Ensure to handle secrets and sensitive data securely in environment variables.
- **Performance**: Make use of caching strategies with React Query and leverage SSR where applicable.
- **Scalability**: Follow best practices for file structure and component design to maintain scalability as the project grows.

## Extending the Template
- **Adding New Routes**: Define new routes in the `routers/` folder and extend the `appRouter` in `root.ts`.
- **Customizing Authentication**: Modify the `auth.ts` file to add new authentication strategies or providers.
- **Styling**: Leverage TailwindCSS to quickly style components, or add custom CSS as needed.


# TODO:
-------
- [ ] Implement shadcn components and styling in demo
- [ ] Implement an example with sockets
- [ ] Implement an example with search e.g. Algolia, Pinecone or something else
- [ ] Logging and website analytics
- [ ] Deployment script
- [ ] Add SEO improvements
- [ ] Fix performance and loading text when website is started
- [ ] Implement themeing i.e. light/dark mode (button on header), inbuilt and custom fonts
- [x] Add JWT token limit for auth
- [ ] Demo a few components e.g. toast/sonner, dialog, tooltip, sidecar and dropdown menu - main view split into grids
